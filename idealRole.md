Technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue

Employment Type: FT Perm or year+ contract

Sector: Any except government

Team Size: > 1. My preference is to work on a team of frontend engineers as opposed to being the only frontend person.

Team role: I have lead experience and am open to that kind of work--but really I just want to work on a team of clever people.

Location: Remote naturally. Post-pandemic, I'm open to commuting in the DC area.

Compensation: $78+/hr on contract or full-time equivalent
