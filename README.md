<h6>For Peter Arseniev, 1994 ‚Äì 2020: You should not be in a tribute. You
	should be here with us. You were so much more than a developer, but I can speak
	to that part of your life because you were my first mentee. Where did your
	knowledge go? Away, with you? Gone, but not wasted. Time forever well spent
	challenging each other's ideas--an unexpected and aggravating reciprocity in a
	senior/student relationship. Especially aggravating were the not-infrequent
	times you were right. You taught me more about being a lead than I ever taught
	you about code. I miss you, Peter.</h6>
