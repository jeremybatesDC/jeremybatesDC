	</summary>
	<span><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❝ Despite the high cost of living, it remains popular. ❞<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❝ Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read. ❞<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❝ If brute force doesn't work, you're not using enough. ❞<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❝ [Have a good day] Thank you, but I've made other plans. ❞<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❝ When you come to a fork in the road, take it. ❞<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❝ It is like a finger that points to the moon. Don't look at the finger, or you will miss all the heavenly glory. ❞<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❝ You can't throw coals without burning your hand. ❞

	<summary><strong>⚾ Baseball Anecdotes</strong></summary>
	<span>

- David Ortiz once stole my pen.

- Roger Clemens yelled at me in the dugout during an actual game. [expand upon this story]. [add best angry rocket pic]

- Greg Maddux gave me a great answer to a question at his 300th win press conference. [find pic]

- Barry Bonds politely declined to answer a question and that night hit 660. Coincidence?

- Serendipitously saw the MLB debut of childhood teammate when he was announced as LA's reliever. I surprised him right back in the clubhouse!

- At a Chopt in Rosslyn, I saw this guy who looked like Bryce Harper and was wearing a beany and had distinctive mole under his eye--waaaa it WAS Bryce. "Bryce?"
"I'm eating."
It was early in the 2014 season when he was wasting at bats trying to bunt against a shift, and dammit I wanted to say something. But you don't presume to make suggestion to a world-class athlete--especially when starstruck. And, it's true, he was eating--albeit near the plastic utensils in a counter-service high-output lettuce emporium.
So I said the truest thing instead, which was "I watch the game to see you swing." His countenance changed, a modest grin escaped, and he extended his fist for a glorious bump.
That night he tripled with the bases loaded! And, because Bryce, he dove into third--even though he'd just made the (April) game 6-1. On his head-first slide, he tore a ligament in his left thumb.
But, with ZERO doubt, contrary to the ostensible causality, this is in no way my fault. Bryce, you see, only bats left handed. He throws, and bumps, with his right :-)
- When I was four, we went to a New Britain Red Sox game. A man was signing autographs and my dad said he was a great pitcher--so we waited in line. When we reached the front of the line, the legendary Bob Feller spoke to me. "Get your elbow off the table, kid."
- As a reporter, I was also able to ask questions of Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson, and yes, even Clemens (who didn't seem to recognize me after his start the next day. The fisherman's hat I wore that day may have helped...).

<h6>For Peter Arseniev, 1994 – 2020: You should not be in a tribute. You
	should be here with us. You were so much more than a developer, but I can speak
	to that part of your life because you were my first mentee. Where did your
	knowledge go? Away, with you? Gone, but not wasted. Time forever well spent
	challenging each other's ideas--an unexpected and aggravating reciprocity in a
	senior/student relationship. Especially aggravating were the not-infrequent
	times you were right. You taught me more about being a lead than I ever taught
	you about code. I miss you, Peter.</h6>
