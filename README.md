<!--learn always - reduce complexity at every opportunity. - "write code, not too much, mostly functions."
accessibility is soul of internet name things well / legibility > micro-optimizations
spend most time reading not writing code -- kyle simpson
empower designers and allow them to see right away what available component options are. This avoids the issue that harms so many projects: inadvertent functional requirements drawn into designs.
gotta ship. if you're doing a site at an agency, avoid looking at client site in production. They do weird stuff with it and, as long as you've workd to educate client ahead of time with documentation too, you've just got to let it go. Kind of like being a journalist and not reading your stuff in print because invariably the editor will tweak it in ways you don't want/like. But that's the reality. gatekeepers are assholes. don't be one. share and learn together -->

	<summary><strong>⚾ Baseball Anecdotes</strong></summary>
	<span>
<br>

* David Ortiz once stole my pen.
* Roger Clemens yelled at me in the dugout during an actual game. [expand upon this story]. [add best angry rocket pic]
* Greg Maddux gave me a great answer to a question at his 300th win press conference. [find pic]
* Barry Bonds politely declined to answer a question and that night hit 660. Coincidence?
* Serendipitously saw the MLB debut of childhood teammate when he was announced as LA's reliever. I surprised him right back in the clubhouse!
* At a Chopt in Rosslyn, I saw this guy who looked like Bryce Harper and was wearing a beany and had distinctive mole under his eye--waaaa it WAS Bryce. "Bryce?"
"I'm eating."
It was early in the 2014 season when he was wasting at bats trying to bunt against a shift, and dammit I wanted to say something. But you don't presume to make suggestion to a world-class athlete--especially when starstruck. And, it's true, he was eating--albeit near the plastic utensils in a counter-service high-output lettuce emporium.
So I said the truest thing instead, which was "I watch the game to see you swing." His countenance changed, a modest grin escaped, and he extended his fist for a glorious bump.
That night he tripled with the bases loaded! And, because Bryce, he dove into third--even though he'd just made the (April) game 6-1. On his head-first slide, he tore a ligament in his left thumb. Nats' fans shared his pain, and it was a somber night. Of small relief is that, contrary to the ostensible causality, I bore no part of the responsibility. Bryce, you see, only bats left. He throws, and bumps, right.
* When I was four, we went to a New Britain Red Sox game. A man was signing autographs and my dad said he was a great pitcher--so we waited in line. When we reached the front of the line, the legendary Bob Feller spoke to me. "Get your elbow off the table, kid."
* As a reporter, I was also able to ask questions of Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson, and yes, even Clemens (who didn't seem to recognize me after his start the next day. The fisherman's hat I wore that day may have helped...).

<sub>For Peter Arseniev, 1994 – 2020: You should not be in a tribute. You
	should be here with us. You were so much more than a developer, but I can speak
	to that part of your life because you were my first mentee. Where did your
	knowledge go? Away, with you? Gone, but not wasted. Time forever well spent
	challenging each other's ideas--an unexpected and aggravating reciprocity in a
	senior/student relationship. Especially aggravating were the not-infrequent
	times you were right. You taught me more about being a lead than I ever taught
	you about code. I miss you, Peter.</sub>
